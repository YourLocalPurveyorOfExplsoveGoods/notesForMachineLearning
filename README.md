# notesForMachineLearning
This repository is my personal storage of my programming notes (JupyterNB) as, I further delve into Machine Learning. Feel free to use them, as a guide, as I comment heavily throughout notebooks.

Currently, going through ISLP. As this repository grows, I'll make sure to keep everything tidy and easily retrievable.
